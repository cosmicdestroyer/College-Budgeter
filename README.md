To get the working build, "Fork" my project and you can do whatever modifications you want to "your fork" and after you've implemented a screen or wrote some code, you can "push" your build to "your fork" and then create a "Pull Request." I will review your modifications and if everything looks good, I will merge them with the "master" that I have.

Meanwhile, BEFORE you start I strongly request you all to watch the YouTube playlist that I've created and linked below. It explains really well how Git works. If not all, I suggest watching at least the "Introduction to Git - Remotes" by David Mahler, to get an understanding of the basics of GitHub and what you're supposed to do and what to do to keep up with my "master" because I will also work on the project and "push" my changes to GitHub. This way your fork's "master" can be synced up with my "master" in the case that I have updated my "master" project.

I have also added a Word document called "Git Notes" which contains all the commands you need to know and some notes. This is a great resource for checking in on commands in Git Bash. I hope it will make your Git experience way better.
