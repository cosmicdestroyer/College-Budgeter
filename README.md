To get the working build, "Fork" my project and you can do whatever modifications you want to "your fork" and after you've implemented a screen or wrote some code, you can "push" your build to "your fork" and then create a "Pull Request." I will review your modifications and if everything looks good, I will merge them with the "master" that I have.

I have added the Categories.docx Word file. This doc has all the questions for all the categories that need to be implemented in the respected screen mentioned in the Doc. For example, ALL the questions in the "Shopping (Dresses)" category MUST be implemented in Screen 4 not anywhere else. This will be more convenient for the user and also for us, since we don't need to code an entirely different screen and also increase the app size. If you are not sure how to implement a ScrollView, check any screen from SC2 to SC10 since I have implemented a ScrollView in all of those screens.

Meanwhile, BEFORE you start I strongly request you all to watch the YouTube playlist that I've created and linked below. It explains really well how Git works. If not all, I suggest watching at least the "Introduction to Git - Remotes" by David Mahler, to get an understanding of the basics of GitHub and what you're supposed to do and what to do to keep up with my "master" because I will also work on the project and "push" my changes to GitHub. This way your fork's "master" can be synced up with my "master" in the case that I have updated my "master" project.

I have also added a Word document called "Git Notes" which contains all the commands you need to know and some notes. This is a great resource for checking in on commands in Git Bash. I hope it will make your Git experience way better.
